# Virtual Tourist
Udacity Project: Virtual Tourist

Virtual Tourist is one of the Portfolio Apps for the iOS Developer Nanodegree from Udacity. It was created to demonstrate persisting a complex model using Core Data, and plist persistence of an array of dictionaries.

## The App
The Virtual Tourist app downloads and stores images from Flickr. The app allows users to drop pins on a map, as if they were stops on a tour. Users will then be able to download pictures for the location and persist both the pictures, and the association of the pictures with the pin.

## Requirements
This application was built using Xcode 10.2.1 and can be run on iOS 12 devices or simulators.
